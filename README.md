<h1> REAL-TIME RIDE-SHARE TRACKING </h1>

MY APPROACH FOR THIS APP

• I used @googlemaps/react-wrapper package for the maps wrapper and rendering google maps on the page <br />
• I used also @ubilabs/threejs-overlay-view for a good threejs overlay view for viewing the routes well together with three to view the map in 3D



FEATURES IN THIS APP

• An interactive map displaying the entire route with marked stops. <br />
• Real-time tracking of the driver's current location using A car displaying where he is following following a certain speed he/she is using <br />
• Showing ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) together with the distance <br />
• Enhanced user experience by incorporating 3D visualization for displaying the route and the driver's progress along it. <br />
• Implemented error handling mechanisms, such as handling Geolocation API errors and API request failures, <br />

Recommended Technologies: <br />
* Front-end: React.js <br />
* Google Maps API for mapping and routing functionalities. <br />
