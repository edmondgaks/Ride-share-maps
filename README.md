<h1> REAL-TIME RIDE-SHARE TRACKING

MY APPROACH FOR THIS APP

• I used @googlemaps/react-wrapper package for the maps wrapper and rendering google maps on the page



FEATURES IN THIS APP
• An interactive map displaying the entire route with marked stops.
• Real-time tracking of the driver's current location using A car displaying where he is following following a certain speed he/she is using
• Showing ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) together with the distance
• Enhanced user experience by incorporating 3D visualization for displaying the route and the driver's progress along it.
• Implemented error handling mechanisms, such as handling Geolocation API errors and API request failures,

Recommended Technologies:
 Front-end: React.js
 Google Maps API for mapping and routing functionalities.
